##  Dataset

**Source**: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

- Collected from 33 Fitbit users over a 30-day period.
- Includes information on:
  - Daily activity (`dailyActivity_merged.csv`)
  - Sleep habits (`sleepDay_merged.csv`)
  - Heart rate and steps (minute/hourly level)
  - Weight logs (`weightLogInfo.csv`)

---

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

Performed the following steps using **[Excel]**:

- Removed duplicate records and null entries
- Formatted date columns to `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Standardized column names (`snake_case`)
- Merged multiple files using `Id` and `ActivityDate`
- Created calculated fields such as `Sleep Efficiency`

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis

Key trends discovered:

- Users who sleep **7+ hours per night** are more active the next day.
- There is a strong correlation between **steps taken and calories burned**.
- The majority of users are **sedentary**, with very few engaging in high-intensity activity.
- Weekend activity levels tend to drop compared to weekdays.

---

##  Visualizations

Visuals created using **[Tableau]**:

- Bar chart: Average steps per user
- Pie chart: Activity levels (Very Active, Light, Sedentary)
- Line graph: Sleep duration over time
- Scatter plot: Calories vs. Total Steps

*(Screenshots or links to Tableau dashboards can be added here.)*

##  Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following marketing strategies are recommended for Bellabeat:

- **Promote mindfulness and sleep-tracking features** of the Bellabeat Leaf to appeal to wellness-focused users.
- **Segment users** based on activity levels and target sedentary users with motivational reminders.
